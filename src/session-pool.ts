/**
 * Pure reaping policy for the live-session pool (Full-pool Agent Dashboard).
 *
 * Backgrounded sessions stay live so re-focusing is always lossless, but a live
 * `grok agent stdio` process per session isn't free — so the pool is bounded two
 * ways: an idle TTL (a session untouched for `idleTtlMs` is torn down) and an LRU
 * cap (`maxLive` live processes; the least-recently-used eligible sessions are
 * reaped to stay under it). Reaping is **silent** — the user just sees the dot go
 * cold; re-clicking the row re-loads it from grok's on-disk history.
 *
 * What's NEVER reaped: the focused session, and any `working`/`needs-you` session
 * (tearing down mid-turn or mid-approval would lose work the user can't see). The
 * cap may therefore be exceeded if every extra session is busy — by design.
 *
 * Selection is pure so it can be unit-tested without a process pool: the caller
 * maps its Session pool to candidates carrying just `{status, lastActiveAt,
 * focused}` (plus whatever back-reference it needs), and disposes whatever this
 * returns.
