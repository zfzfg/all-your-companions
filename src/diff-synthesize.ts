/**
 * Universal diff synthesis (docs/UNIVERSAL_DIFF_SUPPORT_PLAN.md § 3).
 *
 * Grok and Codex already report an ACP `{ type: "diff" }` content block on
 * their edit tool calls; Antigravity (agy), Claude, and native Gemini often
 * don't — they report only the tool's raw parameters. This module builds the
 * same block shape from those parameters so the chat webview's existing
 * diff-viewing pipeline (`applyToolDiffs` in media/chat.js) works the same
 * way regardless of which CLI produced the edit.
 *
 * Pure — no `fs`, no `vscode`. Callers read the file (when a whole-file
 * `oldText` is needed) and pass the text in as `diskText`.
