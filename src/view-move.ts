// View placement. The view is default-homed in the SECONDARY side bar
// (`viewsContainers.secondarySidebar`, VS Code >= 1.106 — hence the engines
// floor), with one extension-owned container contributed per dock location.
//
// Two mechanisms, and the difference between them is the whole of this file:
//
//   - `vscode.moveViews` names a CONTAINER. It is what the automatic first-run
//     correction uses. Its limit is that a host may accept our container and
//     ignore where it declared it lives — Cursor renders the panel one in the
//     primary side bar — so it can relocate the view but cannot choose the dock.
//   - `workbench.action.moveFocusedView` names a LOCATION, via the host's own
//     picker, and so reaches docks no container id of ours can address. It is
//     the only thing the gear offers where our secondary-side-bar container was
//     refused. The view-id argument is what makes it work there at all: Cursor
//     never sets the `focusedView` context key for webview views.
//
// That command does NOT wait for the pick — it resolves as the quickpick opens
// — so nothing may be issued after it. A reveal tried there stole focus and
// dismissed the picker.

 * Where to move the view, or null to leave it where it is.
 *
 * The manifest homes the view in the secondary side bar. Cursor 3.15 refuses to
 * create that container — *"View containers cannot be contributed to the
 * Secondary Side Bar in Cursor. It is reserved for Cursor's agent UI"* — so the
 * view is dropped into Explorer, `workbench.view.extension.grokSidebar` never
 * registers, and `grok.open` fails with "command not found". The extension
 * cannot be opened at all there.
 *
 * The manifest is static and cannot branch per editor, so the correction has to
 * happen at runtime, using the same `vscode.moveViews` call the gear menu
 * already ships.
 *
 * Decided by CAPABILITY, never by `env.appName`: any fork adopting the same
 * restriction is handled without naming it, and a Cursor build that lifts the
 * restriction stops triggering this with no change here. Same reasoning as the
 * relay's rule — gate on the thing being present, not on a version or a brand.
 *
 * **Target is the PANEL, not the activity bar.** A panel docked right occupies
 * the same screen position and the same tall, narrow shape the chat was designed
 * for; the primary side bar puts it opposite the editor and competes with the
 * file tree for the space users already keep open. The caller pairs this with
 * `workbench.action.positionPanelRight` so the result is a secondary side bar in
 * everything but name.
 *
 * **Fires only on a FIRST-EVER run**, and that is a hard rule with nothing
 * guessed in it. There is no way to ask where a view lives — `resetViewLocation`
 * exists for every view in the workbench, moved or not, and the context key that
 * distinguishes them is unreadable from an extension. So "correct it only when
 * it is in Explorer", which is the rule anyone would want, cannot be written.
 *
 * What CAN be established is that the user has not placed it: an install with no
 * stored state has never been interacted with, so wherever the view sits, nobody
 * chose it. That is provable rather than inferred. Every later run leaves the
 * layout alone — including for someone who moved the chat with the editor's own
 * Move To, which leaves no trace we could have read.
 *
 * The cost, stated plainly: a user already on a broken placement is not
 * rescued by an update. They get a chat that opens (`grok.open` no longer
 * throws — the actual outage) and one trip through `Move view…`.
