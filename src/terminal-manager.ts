 * Choose the shell for the agent's `terminal/*` commands (spawn's `shell`

 * default). On POSIX, use `$SHELL` when it is an absolute path (typically
 * `/bin/zsh` on macOS), else `/bin/sh` (Node's `shell: true`). See issue #46.
 *
 * The extension is the one running commands — grok delegates every one over ACP
 * `terminal/create` — so the host shell is *our* choice, not a CLI flag. Under
 * cmd.exe the agent couldn't reach the user's PowerShell profile functions or
 * run pipelines, so it had to re-wrap each command; matching PowerShell (as the
 * standalone CLI already does) removes that friction. The POSIX half is the same
 * idea: a GUI-launched VS Code host otherwise always gets `/bin/sh` (macOS:
 * bash 3.2), which is not the zsh login shell the TUI runs under.
 *
 * POSIX actually spawns `[host, '-c', script]` (`posixSpawnArgv`); Node's
 * `shell:` option is Windows-only here. Node runs a string shell as
 * `<shell> -c "<command>"`, and both pwsh and Windows PowerShell accept `-c`
 * as the `-Command` alias, so the agent's command string runs with PowerShell
 * semantics. We deliberately don't force `-NoProfile`: profile-defined
 * functions/modules are exactly what users expect commands to reach (and what
 * standalone grok reaches).
 *
 * `pref = "cmd"` is the escape hatch (`grok.terminalShell`): force cmd.exe on
 * Windows, `/bin/sh` on POSIX, for anyone the default host bites — e.g. the
 * `powershell.exe` 5.1 fallback rejects `&&` chains and collapses non-zero
 * native exits to 1 (pwsh 7 does neither).
