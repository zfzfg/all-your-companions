/**
 * Put the chat somewhere this editor will actually show it.
 *
 * Cursor 3.15 refuses `viewsContainers.secondarySidebar` — reserved for its own
 * agent UI — so our container is never created, the view is dropped into
 * Explorer, and `workbench.view.extension.grokSidebar` never registers. The
 * manifest is static and cannot branch per editor, so the correction runs here,
 * with the same `vscode.moveViews` payload the gear menu already ships
 * (`vscode-host.ts` → `relocateView`).
 *
 * Runs on **startup**, not on first use. Someone whose chat is buried in an
 * Explorer section has no way to open it, so a correction that waits for them to
 * open it never runs — which is why the manifest asks for `onStartupFinished`
 * despite that entry having been dropped as redundant back in 1.x.
 *
 * ONCE, ever — not once per release. Where a view sits is the user's, and the
 * editor's own Move To leaves no trace we can read, so after the first
 * correction there is no way to tell someone who deliberately moved the chat
 * from someone who never touched it. Correcting again would overrule the first
 * of those on every update. See {@link PlacementRecord}.
 *
 * Focus follows the move on purpose. Arriving from a chat you could not open, a
 * silent re-home to a dock you were not looking at is indistinguishable from
 * still being broken.
 *
 * It applies the move ONCE, here. An earlier revision also re-applied it when
 * the view first resolved, on the theory that a move issued at startup might be
 * lost — instrumenting a real Cursor disproved that (it never failed), and the
 * re-apply then became a hazard of its own: moving the view through the host's
 * picker rebuilds the webview, which fired the pending re-apply and dragged the
 * chat back out of the location the user had just chosen.
 *
 * It aims at a CONTAINER, which bounds what it can achieve: a host may keep our
 * container and ignore where it declared it lives — Cursor renders the panel one
 * in the primary side bar. Reaching a dock the host draws for itself needs a
 * LOCATION, and only the host's own picker takes one, which is what
 * `Grok: Move Chat View` and the gear's `Move view…` open.
 *
 * Failure is swallowed: a host that rejects the move must not take activation
 * down with it, and `grok.open` resolves its command independently.
