/**
 * Pure parsing and command construction for the file panel's Changes view.
 *
 * Nothing here spawns anything. `src/git-run.ts` owns the process seam; this
 * module owns every decision that can be made from text, which is all of them
 * except running the command. That split is what makes the interesting parts
 * testable: porcelain output with a space in a path, a repository with no
 * commits yet, a branch with no upstream, a rename, a conflict.
 *
 * Two rules run through the whole file and are worth stating once.
 *
 * **One structure decides what runs and what is written down.**
 * {@link planGitOp} returns the exact `git` argument vectors together with
 * {@link renderSteps}'s rendering of them, so the two cannot drift. The
 * rendering goes to the HOST LOG, not to the person: the view's confirmation
 * surface is the button's own label, which promises the outcome in plain
 * language ("Commit and push") rather than reciting a command line. Somebody
 * committing from a phone is not auditing argv, and a card full of flags would
 * be exactly the duplicated information this view is built to avoid. The log
 * line is what makes an operation reconstructable afterwards.
 *
 * **Nothing user-supplied becomes an argument without passing a validator
 * here.** Paths are checked against the snapshot the host just computed
 * (`--` and a pathspec are not enough on their own: `git checkout -- x` is
 * fine, but the path still has to be a path this repository is reporting as
 * changed), and branch names go through {@link isValidBranchName}.
