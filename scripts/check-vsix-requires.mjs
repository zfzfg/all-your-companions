/**
 * Fail packaging if the vsix would ship code that cannot load.
 *
 * `out/` is plain `tsc` output, not a bundle, so every `require()` in it is
 * resolved at runtime against whatever actually made it into the package. The
 * file list is an allowlist in `.vscodeignore` maintained by hand, and nothing
 * checked that the two agreed — so the failure mode is an extension that
 * installs cleanly, then throws on activation before registering a single
 * command. Every `Grok:` command reports "not found" and the sidebar never
 * appears. The user has no way to tell that apart from a broken editor.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. Two separate releases shipped it:
 *
 *   3.2.0-3.2.5  out/sidebar.js required ./desktop/desktop-policy, which
 *                .vscodeignore excluded (#101). Six dead releases; the report
 *                came from a user, not from us.
 *   2.x          a hand-rolled `vsce package --no-dependencies` dropped
 *                node_modules/ws, which out/remote-uplink.js requires. The
 *                extension installed and did not load at all.
 *
 * Both are the same bug — packed code requiring unpacked files — so this checks
 * both directions: relative requires must resolve to a packed file, and bare
 * requires must resolve to a packed dependency. It also refuses unexpected
 * packed deps: the Codex adapter's declared tree (especially @openai/codex
 * platform binaries) must install for `npm list` but must not enter the vsix.
 *
 * Runs from `prepackage`, so it gates `npm run package` and therefore CI, which
 * already packages on every push and PR.
