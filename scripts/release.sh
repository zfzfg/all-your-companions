# Extension release for grok-build-vscode on macOS/Linux/WSL.
# Publishes the VSIX and Open VSX.
#
# Bump package.json + write the changelog section FIRST (those stay
# user-initiated), then run:
#   ./scripts/release.sh                 # extension release (incl. real-grok test:live)
#   ./scripts/release.sh --no-test       # skip ALL gating (tsc + npm test + test:live)
#   ./scripts/release.sh --skip-live     # keep tsc + npm test, skip only real-grok test:live
#   ./scripts/release.sh --skip-integration  # skip only the real-VS-Code Extension Host smoke
#   ./scripts/release.sh --skip-ci-wait  # tag without waiting for CI on the pushed SHA
#   ./scripts/release.sh --ci-timeout 30 # minutes to wait for CI (default 20)
#   ./scripts/release.sh --no-install    # do not install the released vsix locally
#   ./scripts/release.sh --dry-run       # print what it would do
#   ./scripts/release.sh -F .git/MSG     # commit with a message file
#
# Steps: assert main -> tsc+test+integration+live -> assert tag free ->
#        npm run package -> commit -> push main -> WAIT FOR CI GREEN ->
#        annotated tag -> push tag -> gh release create (changelog section as
#        notes, .vsix attached) -> npm run publish:ovsx -> install locally.
#
# Open VSX is part of the release. The VS Code Marketplace is deliberately NOT —
# that one is the owner's, a separate explicit step (npm run publish).
