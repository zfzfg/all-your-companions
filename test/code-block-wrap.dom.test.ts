/**
 * #181 — a fenced block clipped the reporter's text at the right edge.
 *
 * The screenshot was an `AGENTS.md` the agent had proposed: PROSE inside a
 * fence, not code. That distinction is the whole design. A sentence sheared off
 * at the right edge is simply lost — you cannot tell there is more, and the
 * horizontal scrollbar sits below the fold of a tall block. Wrapped code only
 * loses its alignment, which is visible and recoverable.
 *
 * So the default is per-language: prose fences wrap, real code keeps its
 * horizontal scroll, and a per-block toggle covers whichever default is wrong
 * for the block in front of you. Per block and not a setting, because one
 * transcript routinely mixes a proposed README with a diff and a shell command.
