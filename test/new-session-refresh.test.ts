/**
 * A new local session must refresh the project's conversation list.
 *
 * The symptom was oddly specific: starting a new session moved the project to
 * the top of the rail but added no row for the conversation, and only closing
 * and reopening the project made it appear. Both halves are explained by
 * `newFocusedSession` posting the repo CATALOG (which re-sorts projects by
 * recency) and never the sessions LIST (which is where the rail's rows come
 * from). The remote path has always sent its own list; only the local one
 * missed it, so it went unnoticed until the desktop grew a rail.
 *
 * This is a source-shape guard, and worth being honest about: it proves the
 * call is present and correctly ordered after the sweep, not that the frame
 * reaches the webview. The end-to-end path needs a real host and lives in the
 * integration suite. What it does buy is a failure that is loud — the bug it
 * guards is invisible locally and only shows up as "the rail is stale".
