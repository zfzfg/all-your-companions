/**
 * Guards for "VS Code history follows the rail's project selection".
 *
 * History used to be pinned to the open workspace folder on VS Code, and the
 * reason was a good one: the repo switcher was hidden there, so a selection the
 * local user could not see must not decide where Grok reads history or writes
 * files — a phone that switched repos hours ago would have been aiming the
 * desk's New Session at another checkout.
 *
 * The projects rail is that switcher, so the premise is gone and the rule now
 * produces the wrong answer instead: a conversation from project B on screen
 * with A's history beside it. What makes the new rule safe is NOT that the old
 * worry was wrong — it is that a remote's selection provably cannot reach
 * `selectedRepoCwd`. Each assertion below is one leg of that argument, and each
 * fails on exactly the edit that would remove it.
 *
 * Source-level: `GrokSidebar` needs a whole fake Host to construct, and these
 * are one-line invariants rather than behaviours with interesting inputs.
 * `sidebar-portable.test.ts` sets the precedent for the technique.
