/**
 * The VS Code projects rail renders the SAME clone form as the chat, so every
 * message that form can send has to be on the rail's allowlist.
 *
 * `onProjectsRailMessage` drops anything not listed, with only a log line — so
 * an omission is silent by construction. One was missing: pasting a GitHub
 * token cleared the field and left GitHub disconnected with no error.
 *
 * This asserts the allowlist by driving the real handler, because the set
 * itself is private and a test that restated it would just be the same list
 * written twice.
