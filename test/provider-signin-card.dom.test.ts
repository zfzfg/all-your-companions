/**
 * What a person is offered when the agent's sign-in expires MID-CONVERSATION.
 *
 * The offer already existed — `providerState.needsLogin` turns the gear's
 * account row, the model picker and Settings into a sign-in — but every one of
 * those is somewhere else, and the welcome card that spells it out refuses to
 * paint over a live conversation on purpose. So the case this file covers is
 * the one the owner hit from a phone on 2026-09-14: a real conversation on
 * screen, the vendor's "Authentication required" in red, and no route back.
