/**
 * Re-focusing a LIVE conversation must say which agent it belongs to.
 *
 * The symptom is worth recording, because the one detail that looks like a
 * contradiction is the thing that identifies it:
 * switching to a live Codex conversation updated the MODEL PICKER (it showed
 * `gpt-5.6-sol`) while everything around it still said Grok — the composer read
 * "Ask Grok", the working indicator read "grokking", and steering was attempted
 * and refused by a CLI that has no such method.
 *
 * That split is exact. `sessionUiSnapshot` carries `modelChanged`, which sets
 * the model id, and the re-focus paths sent it. `session` is the ONLY frame
 * that sets `state.activeProvider`, `state.availableModels` and the composer
 * placeholder (`media/chat.js` case "session"), and the re-focus path did not
 * send it: cold loads reach it through `startSession`, live re-focuses never did.
 *
 * It is the same omission the `sessionName` comment in `focusSession` already
 * records — a small identity frame missing from a path that replays everything
 * else.
 *
 * A source-shape guard, and honest about it: it proves the call is present and
 * ordered before the transcript replay, not that the frame reaches a client.
 * The end-to-end path needs a real host and belongs in the integration suite.
