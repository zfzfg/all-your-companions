/**
 * A confirmation is the topmost thing on screen, by definition.
 *
 * It asks a question about something the person cannot undo, so nothing may
 * cover it. That has been got wrong three times, and the first two were patched
 * for the one caller that noticed rather than at the root:
 *
 *   2026-08-15  the file panel's own menus opened UNDER the phone's full-screen
 *               panel; raised 1000 -> 1300.
 *   (same era)  the connect wizard opened behind the Settings page that
 *               launched it; given its own 200 override.
 *   2026-09-09  the Changes view's Discard on a phone. The panel goes
 *               full-screen at 1200 and the dialog was painted underneath it,
 *               so tapping Discard appeared to do nothing — leaving a
 *               destructive confirmation floating invisibly behind the panel.
 *
 * No DOM suite could catch this: each drives one page's elements, and this is a
 * relationship BETWEEN stylesheets. So it is asserted against the CSS itself.
 *
 * The stylesheets here are the whole stacking universe for this extension
 * (ported from upstream a933944).
