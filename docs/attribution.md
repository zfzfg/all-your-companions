# Attribution

This project is licensed under the **Functional Source License, Version 1.1, MIT Future License (FSL-1.1-MIT)** — see [LICENSE](../LICENSE). Versions **up to and including 1.8.1** were published under plain MIT and remain MIT.

**What FSL-1.1-MIT means in practice:**

- You're free to **use, copy, modify, and redistribute** this software for any **Permitted Purpose** — your own use, non-commercial education and research, and professional services — for free, including at work.
- The one thing you may **not** do is a **Competing Use**: making this software (or a product or service with substantially similar functionality) available to others commercially — e.g. re-publishing a fork to a marketplace as your own competing extension, or selling a hosted service built from it.
- **Each release automatically becomes plain MIT two years after its publication** (the Future License grant in the LICENSE). From that date on, that version is ordinary MIT code.

**The notice condition still applies.** If you redistribute copies, modifications, or derivatives, you must include the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) (or a link to it) and keep the copyright notices **in all copies** — including **compiled, bundled, or packaged builds** (a `.vsix`, an installed extension, a binary), not just the source. Stripping the notice, or re-publishing this code as your own, is a license violation, not "open source freedom."

## How to attribute this project properly

If you reuse this code or a substantial part of it (for a Permitted Purpose), keep credit to:

- **Author:** Paweł Huryn
- **Original repository:** [phuryn/grok-build-vscode](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode)

Concretely:

1. **Ship the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file** (the copyright notice + FSL-1.1-MIT text) with your distribution — source *and* compiled. This is the part the license actually requires.
2. **Credit the source in your README** — a line like *"Based on [phuryn/grok-build-vscode](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode) by Paweł Huryn, FSL-1.1-MIT."*
3. **If you publish anywhere public** (a marketplace, a store, a hosted service), say it's derived from this project in the listing description, don't present it as original work — and make sure what you publish isn't a Competing Use (see above).
4. **Surface it in-app** where practical — e.g. an About/Credits view.

Items 2–4 are good-faith etiquette built on top of the hard requirements. Do that, stay out of Competing Use, and you're welcome to build on this freely.

## Third-party assets

### Seti UI file icons (desktop file tree)

The desktop app's file-tree panel uses a curated subset of the **[Seti UI](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui)** icons (the same family VS Code's default file-icon theme derives from).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | [jesseweed/seti-ui](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui) (`icons/*.svg`) |
| **License** | MIT — Copyright (c) 2014 Jesse Weed |
| **Vendored at** | [`media/file-icons/`](../media/file-icons/) |
| **License text** | [`media/file-icons/LICENSE-SETI.md`](../media/file-icons/LICENSE-SETI.md) |
| **Wiring** | [`src/desktop/file-icons.ts`](../src/desktop/file-icons.ts) maps extensions → icon ids; SVGs are inlined as `data:` URLs into the panel boot script (no runtime network fetch; CSP-safe). |

The MIT notice above is the hard requirement for redistribution of those SVGs. Do not replace this set with a non-redistributable icon pack without updating this section and the vendored license file.

### Connector vendor marks

Settings → Connectors → On this computer uses the vendors' marks (Airtable, Atlassian, Calendly, Canva, Cloudflare, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Sentry, Stripe) to identify those apps.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Vendored at** | [`media/connector-logos/`](../media/connector-logos/) |
| **Wiring** | `appendConnectorLogo` in [`media/settings.js`](../media/settings.js); sibling URLs of `settings.js`, same pattern as `file-icons/` |

Marks are trademarks of their owners. Inclusion is identification only and does not imply endorsement.
